# Ray-Casting

"Rays linesweep.py" demonstrates ray casting using the line-sweep algorithm. Rays are cast from the mouse point and can be seen by pressing the left mouse button. It also includes a vertex detection algorithm which massively boosts resolution without a big performance hit like increasing the base ray count.
